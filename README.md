If you're designing a full track or a topic from scratch, think of what you want your student to accomplish. 

What is the final project that they will be working on at the very end of your course? This final project should be comprehensive and challenging enough for a student to be able to get a job as a junior developer in that particular topic. It should take between 10-20 hours for a student to complete, and we can adjust that length by simply adjusting the starter code that we’re giving students. As an example, when students complete our Sinatra course, they should be able to build a Twitter clone. 

Map out your final project.  Write an overview. List the requirements and what students should be expected to do to build it. 

In this final project, students will be able to:
1.
2.
3.
4.
etc.

And check out the actual [Fwitter project with requirements for more guidance.](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/sinatra-fwitter-group-project)

Now that you have your final project, let’s think about your course as a map that guides your students to this project.
